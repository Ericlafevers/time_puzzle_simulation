# time_puzzle_simulation
The contained notebook was created for exploring the questions posed in: https://www.quantamagazine.org/20160913-the-physics-of-time-puzzle/

No answers to the questions are given here, only a way to perform the simulations. I am not affiliated with Quanta Magazine or the author of the above article in any way.

The notebook contains my implementation of the simulation structure in Python and some examples of how to use it. You have my permission to utilize, modify, and/or redistribute the notebook file and/or its content as would otherwise be permissable.
